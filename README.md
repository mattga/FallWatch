# FallWatch

HackISU Winner of:
Best Entrepreneurial Hack
Best Healthcare or Wellness Hack by Optum

## Inspiration
What can we do to notify paramedics of domestic medical emergencies at the point it happens? For senior citizens, the highest risk is involuntary tripping and mortally injuring themselves, often undiscovered for hours.

## What it does
FallWatch is an Apple Watch app that detects sudden trips/accidents and triggers preset alarms via the phone, so that text messages are sent to predefined emergency contacts without needing user intervention

## How we built it
We used the accelerometer and the gyrometer to detect sudden changes in the acceleration.

## Challenges we ran into
Syncronization between the Watch and the Iphone is faulty and access to the sensors are limited.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning and using the Watch API in just a day.

What we learned
Syncronization is the key to a successful watch app.

What's next for FallWatch
Fallwatch can be extended to detect fall accidents while doing activities like outdoor biking, hiking and mountaineering.

What is it built with
iOS and WatchKit sdk.
